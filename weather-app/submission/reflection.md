# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
In this project, I primarily used **Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic**, as my key AI partner. Claude was instrumental in several ways:
*   **Collaborative problem-solving and idea generation:** Claude served as a collaborative worker, helping me brainstorm and refine ideas, especially when I provided specific examples or needed to explore different approaches to development tasks.
*   **Pseudocode generation:** I frequently prompted Claude to generate pseudocode for complex logic segments. This approach of starting simple and iteratively refining the pseudocode with Claude's assistance helped significantly in breaking down and structuring complex problems.
*   **Exploring design trade-offs:** I utilized Claude to search through and discuss possible implementation methods. This allowed me to analyze design trade-offs more effectively before selecting a final solution.
*   **NLP pattern adjustment and refinement:** For the natural language processing aspects, I worked with Claude to repeatedly adjust and refine patterns and error handling to manage unusual user queries, which was crucial for achieving robust text understanding.
*   **Debugging assistance:** My interactions with Claude, which I referred to as "AI talks" in my reflection, were very helpful in identifying and finding solutions for technical issues, such as the buffer problems encountered with Jupyter visualizations.
## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I applied several intentional prompting strategies:
*   **Iterative Refinement with Pseudocode:** Instead of seeking finished answers directly, I prompted for pseudocode, started with simple requests, and then made corrections or provided more context iteratively to guide the AI.
*   **"What-if" Scenarios:** I used "what-if" scenarios in my prompts to explore the robustness and capabilities of the AI in different situations, helping to improve the system's AI integration.
*   **Comparative Analysis for Design Choices:** I prompted the AI to search through and present possible implementation methods, allowing me to perform a design trade-off analysis before selecting a solution.
*   **Dialogue for Creative Solutions:** I engaged in a dialogue with AI, moving from simple questions to more complex interactions, which helped in co-creating creative solutions. Documenting these conversations was part of this process.
## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
I am particularly proud of successfully learning to make good and effective use of AI as a collaborative worker. Shifting from using AI merely for generating code to employing it for in-depth problem-solving, such as asking for pseudocode, iteratively refining solutions, and analyzing design trade-offs, was a significant achievement. This deeper integration of AI into my learning and development process was the "greatest challenge and success" of this project. The modular design approach also worked very well, allowing for separate development and testing of components (weather, language parsing, AI response, visuals), which made it simpler to find errors and ensure each part functioned correctly before integration.
## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I might have explored implementing one of the other weather API options I initially considered. I chose `fetch-my-weather` to save time by avoiding API authentication complexities, allowing me to focus more on the AI and natural language processing features. With additional time, I would have liked to tackle the API authentication for other services to potentially access a wider range of data or different features, which could have further enhanced the application.
## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
This project was a rich learning experience, demonstrating that traditional programming methods and new AI strategies can complement each other effectively. The resulting software is a testament to this, being both effective, simple in its modularity, and technically advanced. The process emphasized the importance of designing for the user, as building both direct and natural language interfaces highlighted that not all users interact with applications in the same way, leading to a more inclusive final design. Most importantly, this project has significantly enhanced my ability to use AI effectively in future work and has inspired me to continue enhancing my knowledge and abilities in this domain. The practical experience gained in dealing with errors, designing user interfaces, and ensuring system compatibility will be invaluable for my professional growth.
